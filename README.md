# Path-integral-FYP
My final year project at University of Bath. The Feynman path integral formulation of quantum mechanics is applied to different quantum systems such as the quantum harmonic oscillator and the double well potential. Simulation involves applying a metropolis algorithm to a Euclidean time lattice structure in C++. Data analysis is performed using R.
