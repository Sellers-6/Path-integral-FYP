\- Implement a multithreaded option to the C++ code, consider adding "#pragma omp simd" to forcibly vectorise certain loops


\- Read Mackenzie, whole instantanton section! Should have more details than the Atland Simons book.


\- WKB understanding - Sakurai, use this to evaluate accuracy of simulated values if possible


\- Use Schulmann to learn about the anharmonic potentials


\- Think of arguements as to why we are using the path integral rather than the operator/schrodinger methods. One is that we cannot perturb the DWP in schrodinger???


\- Read about how the Lattice size and spacing effects error (it is very small)


\- Write up sections of the report that have been understood


Extensions:


\- Research how spin can be incorporated into instanton/QHO, understand Grassmann variables and incorporate this into the existing C++ code.


\- Observe what changed when incorporating spin and attempt to understand this
