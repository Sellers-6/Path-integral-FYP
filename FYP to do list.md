\- Finish commenting the C++ code


\- WKB understanding - Shculmann and Sakurai, use this to evaluate accuracy of simulated values


\- Use the Landau and Binder book page 96 to redefine conditions of thermalisation


\- Rethink the Lattice size and spacing, also use these to find a seperate error (add this to the standard error from histogram of E0)


\- Write up sections of the report that have been understood


Extensions:


\- Research how spin can be incorporated into instanton/QHO, understand Grassmann variables and incorporate this into the existing C++ code.


\- Observe what changed when incorporating spin and attempt to understand this
