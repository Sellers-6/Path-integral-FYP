\- Finish commenting the C++ code


\- **Make the thermalisation require validation before finishing, currently performs a set number of sweeps which is assumed to have thermalised the system**


\- Research the expected behaviour of the DWP system to compare against C++ results


\- Write up sections of the report that have been understood


\- WKB understanding - Shculmann and Sakurai


\- Find errors in results using loops and histograms


Extensions:



\- Research how spin can be incorporated into instanton/QHO, understand Grassmann variables and incorporate this into the existing C++ code.



\- Observe what changed when incorporating spin and attempt to understand this
